          <p>The sense of touch is of great interest to both the neuroscience and engineering communities. While the neuroscience community rightly focuses on the fundamental questions about how humans and primates sense, perceive, and act in the physical world using touch, the engineering community, strongly motivated by rapid recent advancements in sensing, robotic, and artificial intelligence technologies, aims to design and manufacture artificial tactile sensors and associated algorithms that facilitate dexterous manipulation using robotic grippers/hands. Closer collaboration between these communities will accelerate the progress of tactile sensor design and application.  </p>
          <p>This workshop aims to bridge the information gap between the neuroscience and engineering communities. Exchanging knowledge between these communities may help move us closer to achieving the most efficient tactile sensor designs, that measure the most relevant tactile information, implemented using the most pragmatic engineering approaches. Reaching this goal could have a profound impact on the field of robotic manipulation. </p>

      <h4 id="RA">The complexity of touch encoding in humans and applying it in tactile sensors</h4>
      <p><b>Dr Rochelle Ackerley (Aix-Marseille University, France)</b></p>
      <p>How real can artificial touch be? How closely does it need to resemble the biology to be useful or convey complex messages? The questions are at the heart of understanding how touch is encoded and applying it to aide dexterous manipulation. I will present insights into touch encoding in humans and how these can be measured. The technique of microneurography allows recordings from inside peripheral nerves in humans and we have learned a lot over the past 50 years about the human tactile system, especially about encoding in the glabrous skin of the hands. New developments in microneurography and the analysis of data mean that the insights from human afferent recordings can be better applied to tactile sensor design. For example, the specific roles of different afferents in the skin and what excites them most. As well as giving a neurophysiological overview, the talk will focus on different aspects of naturalistic touch, where often very subtle signals can produce clear sensations, which can be maximized for sensor design.</p>

      <h4 id="DG">Perception of subtle tactile cues through friction</h4>
      <p><b>Dr David Gueorguiev (Sorbonne University, France)</b></p>
      <p>Humans are able to sense tiny tactile cues such as nanoscale wrinkles on chemically identical materials or chemical differences between materials with identical topography. This ability is surprising considering that the size of corneocytes, which are constitutive of the outer layer of the stratum corneum is larger than the tactile features that the sense of touch is able to perceive. Friction has been linked with the human ability to detect these tiny cues, which is astonishing since finger-surface friction is inherently variable and affected by a large number of phenomena such as the occlusion that develops within a few seconds of touching flat surfaces, stick-slips that perturb smooth tactile exploration, or the orientation of the finger with respect to the direction of the exploratory motion that changes the occurring friction. By recording the acceleration and forces during tactile exploration of surfaces and simultaneously implementing psychophysical tasks, it is possible to study potential processing mechanisms that enable the tactile sense to achieve such an accurate level of perception. Promising metrics have been observed when exploration is constrained but it is not yet clear how the sense of touch isolates meaningful tactile cues within the apparent chaos of natural exploration.</p>

      <p><b>Dr Ben Ward-Cherrier (University of Bristol, UK)</b></p>
      <p>My long-term research aim is to build upper-limb prosthetics with tactile sensing that seamlessly integrates with the human body. I believe neuromorphic tactile sensing technologies will help to achieve this goal. Our research group builds neuromorphic optical tactile sensors and develops spike-based algorithms to solve tactile perception problems such as texture identification, slip detection or contour following.</p>

      <h4 id="LO">Gravity biases the haptic estimation of forces</h4>
      <p><b>Laurent Opsomer (UCLouvain, Belgium)</b></p>
      <p>Successful interaction with an artificial haptic device requires very fine control of fingertip forces, which relies on the integration of cutaneous and proprioceptive feedback. Yet, haptic devices can sometimes be used in environments experiencing changing or altered gravito-inertial accelerations, such as airplanes or space stations, which modulates the proprioceptive feedback and motor commands associated with a specific force output. Here, we examined the influence of gravito-inertial forces on finger force control under isometric conditions, conditions that are frequent when using a haptic interface. We trained participants to reproduce isometric vertical forces on a dynamometer held between the thumb and the index finger in normal gravity, and tested them during parabolic flight creating phases of micro- and hypergravity, thereby strongly influencing the motor commands and the proprioceptive feedback associated with the prescribed vertical forces.</p>
      <p>We found that gravity creates the illusion that upward forces are larger than downward forces of the same magnitude. The illusion increased under hypergravity and was abolished under microgravity. Gravity also affected the control of the grip force employed to secure the grasp. These findings suggest that gravity biases the haptic estimation of forces, which has implications for the design of haptic devices to be used during flight or space activities.</p>
      <br>

      <h4 id="IB">The secret of tiny hand movements to feel and manipulate objects</h4>
      <p><b>Dr Ingvars Birznieks (University of New South Wales, Australia)</b></p>
      <p>This presentation will give insight into sophisticated strategies on how motor control and sensory systems reciprocally cooperate achieving fine control of hand movements. Frictionalinformation is crucial in achieving fine grip force adjustments during manipulation tasks avoiding objects to slip out of hands. Our research has discovered a surprising significant physiological mechanism that small submillimeter range hand movements, which we are not ourselves aware of, significantly enhance human ability to perceive friction differences when object is gripped. The evidence will be presented comprising psychophysics experiments, biomechanical analyses, and object manipulation tasks. By observing hand movement strategies during object manipulation, we notice that yet another mechanism must be used, especially when an object is already lifted and held in hands. Rotational forces (torque) are unavoidably arising when the mass of the object is not perfectly distributed relative to the grip axis and when vertical movement is achieved by rotation in the wrist or elbow joints. We suggest that the advantage of torque-induced object rotation is that it may induce localised slips depending on distance from the rotational centre helping to measure friction without vertical translation with gravity which would endanger grip safety and the object might fall out from the hands.</p>
      <p> We suggest that implementation of such relatively simple movement strategies enabling acquisition of sensory information may substantially enhance capabilities of the robotic and prosthetic devices.</p>
