      <b>Bringing the science of measurement to Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROM’s).</b>
      <p>Almost 60 years ago Georg Rasch, a Danish mathematician, introduced his dichotomous model for responses to a test. Subsequently expanded to polytomous items, such as found in many modern PROM’s, the model has had a profound effect on the creation of new PROM’s and the evaluation of existing PROM’s, particularly in the field of rehabilitation. Jean-Louis Thonnard and his group were at the forefront of this revolution.</p>

      <b>The motion of body center of mass during walking: a review of clinical applications.</b>
      <p>Human walking is usually conceived as the cyclic rotation of the limbs. The goal of lower-limb movements, however, is the forward translation of the body system, which can be mechanically represented by its center of mass (CoM). Lower limbs act as struts of an inverted pendulum, allowing minimization of muscle work, from infancy to old age. The plantar flexors of the trailing limbs have been identified as the main engines of CoM propulsion. Motion of the CoM can be investigated through refined techniques, but research has been focused on the fields of human and animal physiology rather than clinical medicine. Alterations in CoM motion could reveal motor impairments that are not detectable by clinical observation. In asymmetric gaits, the affected lower limb avoids muscle work by oscillating almost passively, but extra work is required from the unaffected side during the next step. Generally, the average work across a stride remains normal. In more demanding conditions (such as walking faster or uphill), the affected limb can actually provide more work; however, the unaffected limb does also, and asymmetry between the steps persists. This “learned” or “acquired” asymmetry is a formerly unsuspected challenge to rehabilitation attempts to restore symmetry. Techniques of selective loading of the affected side, which include constraining the motion of the unaffected limb or forcing the use of the affected limb on split-belt treadmills which impose a different velocity and power to either limb, are now under scrutiny. The study of the three-dimensional trajectory of the CoM motion also represents a clinical frontier. After adjusting for displacement due to the average forward speed, the trajectory assumes an figure-of-eight shape (dubbed the “bow-tie”) with a perimeter about 18 cm long. Its lateral size decreases with walking velocity, thus ensuring dynamic stability. Lateral redirection appears as a critical phase of the step, requiring precise muscle sequencing. The shape and size of the “bow-tie” as functions of dynamically equivalent velocities do not change from child to adulthood, despite anatomical growth. The trajectory of the CoM thus appears to be a promising summary index of both balance and the neural maturation of walking.</p>

      <b>Multi-sensory reference frames for human motor control.</b>
      <p>When planning and executing motions of the body, be they simply movements to raise the arm or more complex tasks of eye-hand coordination, humans anticipate and exploit the force of gravity in order to achieve more accurate or more efficient movements. Experiments in weightlessness have demonstrated that graviception per se does not provide the only cue that allows the CNS to anticipate the effects of gravity. Indeed, human motion is tuned to a multi-sensory representation of “up” and “down” that combines prior knowledge with sensory signals from visual, kinesthetic and vestibular organs. Here we will present an overview of a range of experiments  performed on the ground and in weightlessness that have contributed to our knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms underlying multi-sensory coordination.</p>

      <b>Independent Fingertip Control during Manipulation.</b>
      <p>Behavioral and physiological analyses imply that during multi-finger manipulation tasks the applied force vectors are controlled within boundaries determined by the local frictional conditions. Recently this concept has been implemented in robotic devices and shown to provide a reliable framework for stable manipulation of objects in robotic hands as well as during robot-human interaction.</p>

      <b>Tactile sensitivity in the rat: a correlation between receptor structure and function.</b>
      <p>Single cutaneous fibers were recorded in the median nerve of the anesthetized rat and the receptor morphology in the forelimb glabrous skin was analyzed to establish a probable correlation between receptor anatomy and physiology. The data support the statistical probability that Meissner corpuscles are the anatomical substrate of rapidly adapting type 1 receptors and that Merkel complexes are the source of slowly adapting type 1 responses.</p>

      <b>Grip function of the epidermal ridges of primates.</b>
      <p>There has been considerable debate about the functional advantages of the epidermal ridges for improving grip, which depends upon friction. The interlocking of the ridges with surface topographical features has been proposed to increase the friction but, for smooth surfaces, the ridges will decrease the contact area, and hence the friction. Interlocking occurs, for example, when rubbing a hair fibre between a thumb and finger towards the scalp due to the saw-tooth geometry of the cuticles, and also for slip against rough surfaces. Sweating is a critical factor for improving the grip of primates  and the precise role of moisture is not understood since the friction of both ridged and flat skin increase with increasing hydration due plasticisation that increases the contact area. Here, we propose that the ridges provide a moisture regulation mechanism, which leads to a path independent optimal hydration condition, and that, under wet conditions, they reduce the probability of gross slip due to fluid lubrication. For a finger pad in contact with a glass plate, we found that when moisture accumulates either by secretion from the sweat pores or from an external source, it is only partially absorbed by the skin while the residue is located in the furrows as free water. The moisture is squeezed out of the ridge contact regions into the furrows, thus preventing a fluid film being formed. Unlike flat skin, the moisture is able to evaporate and thus inhibit excessive hydration that is known to cause a reduction in the friction. Thus, we have established why the role of moisture is important in understanding the evolutionary advantages of epidermal ridges in the grip function of primates.</p>

      <b>Tactile Mechanics.</b>
      <p>The astonishing variety of phenomena resulting from the contact between fingers and objects is a formidable trove of information that can be extracted by organisms to learn about the nature and the properties of objects. This richness is likely to have fashioned our somatosensory system at all levels of its organisation, from early mechanics to cognition. I will illustrate this idea through examples and show how the physics of mechanical interactions shape the messages that are sent to the brain; and how the early stages of the somatosensory system en route to the primary areas are organised to process these messages.</p>
