        <h1>Skin mechanics and its role in manipulation and perception</h1>
        <h3>Workshop at the EuroHaptics Conference 2022 <br> Hamburg, Germany </h3>

          <p>During object interaction and tactile perception, our fingertips undergo complex time-varying mechanical deformations that are shaped by the mechanics and geometries of the skin tissues, bones, and nails, and the interacting objects or surfaces. The resulting strain pattern in turn excite different populations of mechanoreceptors in the skin. The precise spiking responses ofthese afferents are then transmitted to and interpreted by the central nervous system to generate an adequate motor response or give rise to a particular tactile percept. Therefore, a precise quantification of the strains and stresses taking place during tactile interactions can shed light on the information provided by the sense of touch and the mechanisms used by the central nervous system that underlie object manipulation and perception. </p>
          <p>This workshop gathers a panel of experts who have brought novel insights on the connection between skin mechanics and object manipulation or tactile perception, and will highlight the many recent advances that have been made in understanding the mechanical properties of the skin and how these affect neural responses and behavior.</p>

      <p>Michaël Wiertlewski is Assistant Professor at the Cognitive Robotics Department of the TU Delft in the Netherlands. He obtained his Ph.D. degree at Sorbonne University. In 2012, he joined the Neuroscience and Robotics (NxR) lab at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, USA, where he studied the physics of ultrasonic friction-modulation. From 2015 to 2019 he was CNRS Chargé de Recherche at Aix-Marseille university. He now leads the Tactile Machines Laboratory, which research interest include the design of tactile interfaces, the physics of the skin/surface interaction and human and robotic tactile perception.</p>

      <h4 id="LW"><a href="mailto:mailto:l.willemet@tudelft.nl">Laurence WILLEMET</a> (TU Delft, The Netherlands)</h4>
      <p>Laurence Willemet is a postdoctoral researcher at the Cognitive Robotics Department of the TU Delft. She received her MS degree in 2017 in technology applied to health in Strasbourg in France. She obtained her PhD degree in 2021 with Aix-Marseille Université in France. She is mainly interested in how humans regulate grasping forces when they interact with rubbery or slippery objects, in the quest of finding a compact representation of the skin deformation that allows human dexterity. She believes that finding the primitives of touch is key to enable dexterous manipulation in soft robots.</p>
