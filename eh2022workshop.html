        <h1>Skin mechanics and its role in manipulation and perception</h1>
        <h3>Workshop at the EuroHaptics Conference 2022 <br> Hamburg, Germany </h3>

          <p>During object interaction and tactile perception, our fingertips undergo complex time-varying mechanical deformations that are shaped by the mechanics and geometries of the skin tissues, bones, and nails, and the interacting objects or surfaces. The resulting strain pattern in turn excite different populations of mechanoreceptors in the skin. The precise spiking responses ofthese afferents are then transmitted to and interpreted by the central nervous system to generate an adequate motor response or give rise to a particular tactile percept. Therefore, a precise quantification of the strains and stresses taking place during tactile interactions can shed light on the information provided by the sense of touch and the mechanisms used by the central nervous system that underlie object manipulation and perception. </p>
          <p>This workshop gathers a panel of experts who have brought novel insights on the connection between skin mechanics and object manipulation or tactile perception, and will highlight the many recent advances that have been made in understanding the mechanical properties of the skin and how these affect neural responses and behavior.</p>
